# System Status: Online

> "I don't trust my brain, so I built a file system that thinks for me."

### 0x01. Manifesto
I am a teacher, investor, and system architect operating in a high-entropy environment.
This profile is not a portfolio; it's a **documentation of my operating system**.

I build tools to:
1.  **Filter** noise from the attention economy.
2.  **Route** information to its proper domain automatically.
3.  **Spar** with ideas to remove cognitive biases.

### 0x02. The Kernel (My Brain Source Code)
If you want to understand how I process the world, look at my routing logic.
This file defines how I categorize reality:

```json
// from: 01_system/router_config.json
{
  "targets": {
    "investing": "03_domains/Investing/notes.md",
    "psychology": "03_domains/Psychology/notes.md",
    "misc": "00_inbox/inbox.md"
  },
  "keywords": {
    "investing": ["rklb", "thesis", "kill_criteria", "asymmetry"],
    "psychology": ["jung", "shadow_work", "projection", "discipline"],
    "media": ["postman", "attention_economy", "algorithm_defense"]
  }
}
0x03. Active Daemons (Current Focus)
🔭 Investing: Long-term position structuring on Space Infrastructure (Focus: $RKLB).
🏫 Teaching: Gamification SOPs for underperforming students (Grade 4).
🧠 Psychology: Integrating Jungian concepts into productivity workflows.
🛡️ Defense: Python scripts for Shadow Reporting and emotional monitoring.
0x04. The Stack (Brutalist Edition)
No databases. No GUI. Just text.
Core: Python 3, Makefile, Bash
Storage: Markdown (Plain Text)
Memory: Vector Embeddings (ChromaDB)
Interface: Terminal
0x05. Communication Protocol
I value Sparring over politeness.
If you open an Issue or PR in my repos, please adhere to:
[E] - Label your evidence.
[I] - Label your inference.
Steel-man my argument before you attack it.
Small talk will be routed to /dev/null.
