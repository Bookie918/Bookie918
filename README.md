## 0x01. Manifesto

I am a teacher, investor, and system architect. This profile is not a portfolio; it is the documentation of my Operating System. I treat cognition as a programmable environment, building tools to:

*   Filter the relentless noise of the attention economy.
*   Route information to its proper domain automatically.
*   Scale critical thinking through rigorous logic and automation.
